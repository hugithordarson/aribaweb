    This interface provides a general mechanism for its clients to set up
    the command line arguments that it is expecteing, to process the arguments,
    and finally to run with the input arguments.

    Normally, a class implementing this interface implements its <code>main</code>
    method which calls the <code>create</code> method of the <code>ArgumentParser</code>
    class, passing in its class name and its command line arguments. Then
    the <code>setupArguments</code> method is called to allow the client to
    register the command line arguments. Then the <code>processArguments</code>
    method is called to allow the client to process its arguments. Finally,
    the <code>startup</code> method is invoked to allow the client to be
    executed.
