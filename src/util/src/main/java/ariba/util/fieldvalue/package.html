<BODY>

The core property access mechanism used by AribaWeb bindings and the Expr
expression language.  FieldValue provides a uniform Map-like (get/set) interface to
objects of various sorts (POJOs, Maps, scriptable objects, ...).  {@link ariba.util.fieldvalue FieldValue}
is implemented as a {@link ariba.util.core.ClassExtension}, meaning that implementation of the FieldValue
abstraction can be done outside of the target classes, thereby allowing implementations
on existing core Java classes (Object, Map, etc).
<p/>
FieldValue provides optimized access for <i>field paths</i> (e.g. "employee.manager.name")
via the {@link ariba.util.fieldvalue.FieldPath} class.  FieldPaths are pre-parsed and
cache the {@link ariba.util.fieldvalue.FieldValueAccessor} to which they last (dynamically)
resolved, thereby avoiding future lookup/reflection on repeated use.
