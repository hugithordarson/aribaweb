    <Overview>
        Provides for a standard Html hyperlink.  AWHyperlink may be wrapped around anything that a normal `<a/>` tag could
            be around.  Allows for binding and action or specifying a pageName so that when the user clicks, the action
            is fired or the named page is displayed.  Optionally, you may use AWHyperlink to submit a form.  Bindings
            which are not mentioned belowed may be passed-though to the opening `<a/>` as arbitrary attributes in the html
            tag.
    </Overview>

    <Binding key="action" direction="get" type="AWResponseGenerating" default="$null" alternates="pageName,href">
        Will be evaluated when the invokeAction phase detects that the hyperlink was clicked.  A value of null should be
        returned to cycle the current page.  Note: it is recommended that you declare your return type to be either
        AWComponent or AWResponse, unless you cannot be sure because you are deferring to another method for the action.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="pageName" direction="get" type="String" required="$false" alternates="action,href">
        In the event you don't need to do anything to setup the state for the returned page, this may be more convenient
        than 'action' since you don't need to write any java code.  This will be evaluated during the invokeAction phase
        in order to get the name of the page to create and return.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="submitForm" direction="get" type="boolean" default="$false">
        Allows for submitting the form in which the hyperlink is defined.  If specified and evaluates to true, javascript
        will be used to submit the enclosing form.  Do not use onClick with AWHyperlink along with submitForm.  [In fact,
        its generally a bad idea to use javascript with any awf components as it conflicts with intenal implementation.]
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="onClick" direction="get" type="string" default="$null">
        As long as submitForm is false, you may associate an onClick with the AWHyperlink, but it is strongly discouraged.
        It would be better to use an AWGenericContainer and build your own at that point.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="omitTags" direction="get" type="boolean" default="$false">
        Allows for not rendering the opening/closing tags of the <a/>.  This makes it easy to avoid duplicating the body
            of the hyperlink just to turn off the link itself.  If true, only the body is rendered.  Since, the tags are
            not rendered, the user cannot click the link so none of the bindings which would apply then have any effect.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="senderId" direction="get" type="String" deprecated="$true">
        Allows for providing your own senderId (eg to allow for human readable senderid).  It is strongly recommended
        that this not be used as the system cannot guarantee proper results if used incorrectly.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="href" direction="get" type="String" default="$null" alternates="action,pageName" deprecated="$true">
        Provide your own href.  Rather than use this, you should consider using a GenericContainer and making your own.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="scrollToVisible" direction="get" type="boolean" default="$false">
        When the link is clicked and the page cycled (same page returned), it will attempt to scroll the page to where
        the link is at the top of the page.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="target" direction="get" type="String" default="$null">
        If provided, will put a target attribute in the tag so the browser will open the returned page in this new window.
        This is not recommened for nor application usage as multi-window apps are problematic.  In any case, we do
        maintain a separate page cache for newly created windows, so this will also place the returned page in that
        separate page cache.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="windowAttributes" direction="get" type="String" default="$null">
        If the target binding is used, you may specify the window attributes with this binding.  See
        book on html/javascript and look for window.open(...) for details.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="fragmentIdentifier" direction="get" type="String">
        If specified, must be the name of another anchor tag on the destination page so the browser can scroll to that link.
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="onMouseDown" direction="get" type="String" deprecated="$true">
        Not supported?
    </Binding>

    <Binding key="behavior" direction="get" type="String">

    </Binding>
