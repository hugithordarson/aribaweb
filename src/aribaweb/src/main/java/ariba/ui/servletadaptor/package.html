Adaptor classes to marry aribaweb with the javax.servlet APIs.
<p/>
Since AribaWeb is designed to be independent of the java servlet APIs (so that it can
be used in alternative environments) this servletadaptor package is necessary to provide
concrete implementations of abstract aribaweb classes such as AWBaseRequest and AWBaseResponse
that adapt AW to servlet containers.
<p/>
Note:
    {@link ariba.ui.servletadaptor.AWServletApplication AWServletApplication} can / should
    serve as the base class for most application-specific application subclasses, and includes
    overridable defaults for settings such as the resourceUrl and the resourceFilePath()
    (which determine how where resources in jars/wars are located at how they are
    referenced in generated URLs).
